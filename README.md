## log
* 0.1.7 (2020-07-09)
  - can choose which eSense controls constantSynth parameter.  can add 3rd synth that can be controlled by both (change0 and change 3) in ~fadeConstantSynts
  - manual threshold added (~rewCalcTask simplified)
  - new GUI;
  - automove disables;
  - enter straight into sea (new practice)
* 0.1.6 (2016-09-05)
* 0.1.3.7 (2016-06-05)

## TODO
- make 3rd constant synth that uses both eSenses to change itself; 
- for consistency, make continuous mapping of eSenses to constantSynts in all islets (they need to fit the rest of the soundscape)
- think about implementing the shamanic method (synchronisation)
- check scale arrays in generate.scd
- think about how attention/meditation should work together;

## NOTE
- tracks start from 0, not 1 (need to be consistent when talking, naming, commenting, etc; )
